# custom_enum_traits

This is designed to become a set of traits designed to make it easier to work with enums.
Currently, there is just one trait, though this may change. Ultimately, all
of these traits are likely to be designed so they are derive-able. The
library for deriving these traits is `derive_custom_enum_traits`.
